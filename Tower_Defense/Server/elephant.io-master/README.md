NOTICE
======
As we are not using Elephant.io anymore at Wisembly, and not having the time to
maintain this library, we are looking for maintainers. Please look at the dedicated
issue #135 !

Installation
============
We are suggesting you to use composer, with the following : `php composer.phar require wisembly/elephant.io`. For other ways, you can check the release page, or the git clone urls.

Documentation
=============
The docs are not written yet, but you should check [the example directory](https://github.com/Wisembly/elephant.io/tree/master/example)
to have a basic knownledge on how this library is meant to work.

Special Thanks
==============
Special thanks goes to Mark Karpeles who helped the project founder to understand the way websockets works.
